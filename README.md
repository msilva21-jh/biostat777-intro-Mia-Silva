Hi!

My name is Mia Silva, the author of \[this\](insert link here once deployed) website. I am a Masters student at Johns Hopkins BSPH in the Department of Biostatistics. Coming from an undergraduate background in cognitive neuroscience and psychology, and a professional background in pediatric diabetes research, I am excited to develop a more robust computational and statistical skill set in order to make a more meaningful, data driven impact in these areas.

This website was created using Quarto and deployed (insert explanation here).
