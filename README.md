Hi! 👋

My name is Mia Silva, the author of [**this website**](https://msilva21-jh.github.io/biostat777-intro-Mia-Silva/) (created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) and deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)). I am a Masters student at Johns Hopkins BSPH in the Department of Biostatistics. Coming from an undergraduate background in cognitive neuroscience and psychology, and a professional background in pediatric diabetes research, I am excited to develop a more robust computational and statistical skill set in order to make a more meaningful, data driven impact in these areas.
