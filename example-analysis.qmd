## [Question]{style="color:  #2D4947;"} 
**The goal is to have a better understanding of traumatic brain injury (TBI) trends and how different causes lead to different outcomes in certain populations. Specifically, how has the incidence of TBI changed over time between 2006 and 2014? How do different mechanisms of injury relate to patient outcomes, and does this differ by age?**

[**Audience:**]{style="color:  #68A39F;"} The general public who are interested in learning more about the relatively recent history of TBI trends and outcomes .

[**Data Source:**]{style="color:  #68A39F;"} This analysis will use data from the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) data set posted by the TidyTuesday project from the Data Science Learning Community. This was originally collected to spread awareness about the incidence and causes of brain injury in America. The specific data used in this analysis was sourced from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/pdf/TBI-Surveillance-Report-FINAL_508.pdf).

[**Incidence Over Time**]{style="color:  #68A39F;"}

:::{.callout-note}
For the purposes of this analysis, "outcome" refers to the level of severity (i.e., how much medical attention received or mortality) following a TBI. This corresponds to "Emergency Department Visits", "Hospitalizations", and "Deaths" in the data set. "Mechanism of injury" and "cause" will be used interchangeably.
