## <span style="color:  #2D4947;"> `r fontawesome::fa("heart", fill = "#2D4947")` Personal Interests</span>

**<span style="color:  #68A39F;"> Hobbies</span>**

- I love music! I grew up listening to a lot of the bands from the 50s and 60s, so my taste in music now has largely been influenced by that. I tend to have an affinity for music inspired by jazz standards and traditional pop and swing. I also played piano for 10 years and definitely miss having more time to practice as a hobby! My life goal is to learn how to play "Merry-Go-Round of Life" from Howl's Moving Castle one day. `r fontawesome::fa("music", fill = "#2D4947")`
- I was a very avid reader growing up, amassing over 220 physical books in my childhood room by the time I exited high school. I've started to reignite my love for reading recently, but now opt for library books -- saving money and supporting our library systems at the same time! `r fontawesome::fa("book-open-reader", fill = "#2D4947")`
- Cozy gaming has become one of my favorite ways to honor my inner child. I particularly enjoy indie games that have cute art styles and calming soundtracks such as Stardew Valley and Smushi Come Home, and nostalgic Nintendo games like Pokemon and Legend of Zelda. `r fontawesome::fa("gamepad", fill = "#2D4947")` 
- I also enjoy drawing and crafting whenever I feel inspired! I've always liked doodling nature and improving my portrait skills. I recently started experimenting with polymer clay as well to make cute little figurines for myself and friends. `r fontawesome::fa("paintbrush", fill = "#2D4947")` 

**<span style="color:  #68A39F;"> Activities</span>**

- Exploring new places `r fontawesome::fa("tree", fill = "#2D4947")`
- Spending time with friends and family `r fontawesome::fa("people-group", fill = "#2D4947")`
- I also enjoy trying new restaurants and cafes, and am always on the lookout for a good cup of coffee or tea `r fontawesome::fa("bowl-food", fill = "#2D4947")` `r fontawesome::fa("mug-saucer", fill = "#2D4947")`
- I hope to travel more in the future, especially internationally `r fontawesome::fa("globe", fill = "#2D4947")`
