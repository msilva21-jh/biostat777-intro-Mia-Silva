It is a very common cause of disability and death, with millions of cases occurring each year in the U.S. alone [@cdc2014]. It's important that we continue to try and understand the etiology, clinical consequences, and trends in TBI incidence to better inform prevention efforts and clinical care.\n\n## [Question]{style=\"color:  #2D4947;\"}\n\n**The goal is to have a better understanding of traumatic brain injury (TBI) trends and how different causes lead to different outcomes in certain populations. Specifically, how has the incidence of TBI changed over time between 2006 and 2014? How do different mechanisms of injury relate to patient outcomes, and zooming in on a specific year, does this differ by age?**\n\n[**Audience:**]{style=\"color:  #68A39F;\"} The general public who are interested in learning more about the relatively recent history of TBI trends and outcomes .\n\n[**Data Source:**]{style=\"color:  #68A39F;\"} This basic analysis will use data from the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) data set posted by the TidyTuesday project from the Data Science Learning Community [@tidytuesday]. This was originally collected to spread awareness about the incidence and causes of brain injury in America. The specific data used in this analysis was sourced from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/pdf/TBI-Surveillance-Report-FINAL_508.pdf) [@cdc2014].\n\n::: callout-important\nLink to GitHub Repo and **data dictionary**: [tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2020/2020-03-24/readme.md).

There is also this recent literature review [@OBASA2024100092] that provides a more detailed and nuanced overview of what TBI is, its classification and clinical significance, and potential long-term outcomes.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## [Analysis]{style=\"color:  #2D4947;\"}\n\n**Reading in data:**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif(!require(\"readr\", quietly = TRUE)){\n  install.packages(\"readr\")\n}\nlibrary(readr)\n\ntbi_age <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2020/2020-03-24/tbi_age.csv')\ntbi_year <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2020/2020-03-24/tbi_year.csv')\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Loading in necessary packages:**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif(!require(\"dplyr\", quietly = TRUE)){\n  install.packages(\"dplyr\")\n}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nif(!require(\"ggplot2\", quietly = TRUE)){\n  install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nif(!require(\"ggtext\", quietly = TRUE)){\n  install.packages(\"ggtext\")\n}\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nif(!require(\"stringr\", quietly = TRUE)){\n  install.packages(\"stringr\")\n}\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nif(!require(\"forcats\", quietly = TRUE)){\n  install.packages(\"forcats\")\n}\nlibrary(forcats)\n```\n:::\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[**Incidence Over Time**]{style=\"color:  #68A39F;\"}\n\n::: callout-note\nFor the purposes of this analysis, \"outcome\" refers to the level of severity (i.e., how much medical attention received or mortality) following a TBI.

When looking at rates of TBI over time, we can see that ED visits account for the majority of TBI cases and seems to be driving the increase of overall cases over the years. Hospitalizations and deaths are less common outcomes, and both remain relatively steady over time. Different mechanisms of injury also appear to be \"drivers\" for different outcomes. For example, TBI due to intentional self-harm has the highest rate over the years for the outcome of death, and unintentional falls account for a large proportion of the rate of TBI-related ED visits and hospitalizations.\n\nWhen zooming in on the year 2014 and looking at TBI cases by age group, we can see that individuals aged 15-24 and 75+ had the highest number of cases. One explanation for this could be that 15-24 is the age range with more risk-taking behavior, and 75+ is when individuals tend to be more physically vulnerable and more prone to falls (based on average number of TBI cases caused by motor vehicle crashes and unintentional falls in the respective age groups). More severe outcomes appear to more likely in older age groups relative to younger ones. Additionally, certain mechanisms of injury appear to be more common in specific age groups; for instance, unintentional falls are much more common in individuals aged 0-4 and 75+, though result in more severe outcomes in the 75+ group.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe differences in TBI incidence and outcomes across age groups and mechanisms of injury can serve to highlight health disparities that need to be addressed, especially with the potential rise in TBI cases over time. For more information on these disparities, you can go to the CDC's webpage on TBI and health disparities [@cdc2025].\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\nData analysis is limited by available information in the data set. Averages could only be taken from total case counts. Rates could not be averaged due to lack of information to take weighted averages. Additionally, age analysis could only be done on the year 2014. For more information on data limitations, you can look at the original surveillance report by the CDC [@cdc2014].\n:::\n\n## [Functions Used]{style=\"color:  #2D4947;\"}\n\n-   **dplyr**: `filter()`, `group_by()`, `summarise()`, `left_join()`, `count()`, `ungroup()`\n-   **ggplot2**: `geom_point()`, `geom_line()`, `geom_bar()`, `scale_color_manual()`, `facet_wrap()`, `labs()`, `theme_bw()`, `theme()`, `scale_x_continuous()`, `geom_text()`\n\n*Other packages*\n\n-   **ggtext**: `element_text()`, `element_textbox_simple()`\n-   **stringr**: `str_wrap()`\n-   **forcats**: `fct_relevel()`\n",
