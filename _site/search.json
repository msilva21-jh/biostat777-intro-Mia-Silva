    "text": "Personal Interests\nHobbies\n\nI love music! I grew up listening to a lot of the bands from the 50s and 60s, so my taste in music now has largely been influenced by that. I tend to have an affinity for music inspired by jazz standards and traditional pop and swing. I also played piano for 10 years and definitely miss having more time to practice as a hobby! My life goal is to learn how to play “Merry-Go-Round of Life” from Howl’s Moving Castle one day. \nI was a very avid reader growing up, amassing over 220 physical books in my childhood room by the time I exited high school. I’ve started to reignite my love for reading recently, but now opt for library books – saving money and supporting our library systems at the same time! \nCozy gaming has become one of my favorite ways to honor my inner child. I particularly enjoy indie games that have cute art styles and calming soundtracks such as Stardew Valley and Smushi Come Home, and nostalgic Nintendo games like Pokemon and Legend of Zelda. \nI also enjoy drawing and crafting whenever I feel inspired! I’ve always liked doodling nature and improving my portrait skills. I recently started experimenting with polymer clay as well to make cute little figurines for myself and friends. \n\nActivities\n\nExploring new places \nSpending time with friends and family \nI also enjoy trying new restaurants and cafes, and am always on the lookout for a good cup of coffee or tea  \nI hope to travel more in the future, especially internationally"
